# Frontend test

This test contains a simple SvelteKit site with some hardcoded data for you to work with. It is a bare-bones installation of SvelteKit with Tailwind 4 installed.

Your task is to complete as many of the below tasks in the checklist as possible in 8 hours. Please don't exceed this maximum time as we are not looking for 100% polished solutions but rather want to see what you prioritise given this time constraint.

Please avoid using too many third-party packages. Using some low level library is fine but adding too many prebuilt Svelte components from `npm` feels like it defeats the purpose of the test. Instead, show us your engineering personality & taste!
